##object detection using SIFT & ORB

this project implements an object detection system using SIFT & ORB algorithm.when you run the code, the front camera displays
a blue bounding box. if an object is placed inside the blue box,its color changes,indicating that the object has been detected.

##project overwiew

**algorithm used:** SIFT & ORB for feature detection and matching.
**objective:** to detect objects places inside a predefined bounding box using real-time camera input.
**camera:** uses the front camera for live object detection.

##features

**real-time detection:** the system works in real-time, providing immediate feedback when an object is placed inside
the bounding box.

**dynamic bounding box:** the blue bounding box changes color upon detecting an object.
** feature  matching:** uses SIFR & ORB to identify and match object features within the bounding box.
